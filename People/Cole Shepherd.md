# About Me

Hey, I’m Cole! I’m 27 and I’m based in Seattle, WA. I worked at Rec Room from 2018 - 2020 as a server engineer, and after a short stint at another company I’m excited to be re-joining the server team!

Outside of work you’ll usually find me playing guitar or piano, staying active with bicycling and weight-lifting, playing Nintendo Switch (just got one, I’m a little behind the curve), or watching Netflix.

I’m looking forward to working with you all again!
