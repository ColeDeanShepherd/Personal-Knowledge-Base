* I am not perfect, but I am enough
* Though my mind will fight it, I will maintain presence, calm, and brevity
* I will bring positivity into the world
* I will put myself in othersâ€™ shoes instead of casting judgement on them
* I will continually improve myself
* I will not let my comfort zone control & limit me
